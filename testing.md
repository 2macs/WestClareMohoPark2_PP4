#### Bugs
<br />

* The Navbar heading 'West Clare Motorhome Park (extended through the header) is not fully responsive, on very small screens parts of the heading disappears from view. I have tried to define a media query to change the font size once a certain screen size is met but this hasn't worked. Also have tried inline bootstrap to change the size but to date this hasn't worked either. Am consulting with a professional on this and will fix for next release.

* When a user logs in, if another user has just logged out - Django generates a 'you have logged out' message' on the same screen as 'You have successfully logged in' . This seems to be a question asked on various forums and playing with the redirect on logout constant seems to be the fix. At this point am highlighting this and will fix / remove for next release.

* On the booking form, there is validation preventing a user from inputting an arrival date earlier than the current date. At the moment there is no validation preventing a user from defining a departure date earlier than the arrival date. I spent significant time trying to figure this out and also contacted tutor support who could not help immediately. I expect this will be fixed with next release.
