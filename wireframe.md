# Wireframe
### Purpose
The purpose of the wireframe was to help to formulate thoughts and designs ahead of starting the coding process. Some of the features of the wireframe have been included in the final design and some will / can go in as later additions. For the booking data model, some aspects such as EHU were omitted as most sites provide EHU ( Electric Hook Up ) as standard now and is seldom not required. 

### Page 1 
The main purpose of page 1 is to grab the visitors attention , quickly show the visitor what amenities are available, what the views are like from the site etc. Visitors like to see / know that there are quiet time rules and that these will be enforced. The page will also give the vsiitor an idea where the site is and how to get there although with modern Sat Nav systems this is less important. MS Powerpoint was used to quickly put the wireframe together, as Balsamique required a licence update.

### Page 2
The purpose of page 2 is to give visitors an idea as to what special places of ineterst are nearby. This is to facilitate planning for day trips etc. Also, often people come to a motorhome park to see some specific attraction and want to know that it's nearby. West Clare is famous for the cliffs of Moher and Burren area so proxomity to these areas will be of interest to a visitor.

### Page 3
The purpose of page 3 is to give the visitor a number of options for contacting the site ownership, the page will show the site telephone number, email address and an enquiry form that the vsisitor can fill out. The enquiry form will have the visitor email address such that the site owner can respond to the enquiry.

### Page 4
Page 4 is meant to provide a vsisitor the capabability to leave a review of the site, these reviews could then be viewed on the home page (page 1 ). Due to time constraints, this functionality will be scheduled to be delivered in a later release of the app.

### Page 5
The purpose of page 5 is to enable the visitor to make a booking. The booking will ask for standard details such as name, email address, arrive date and departure date. For initial release, the booking will be taken and confirmed by the site owner. Future release will contain logic that provides feedback on site capoacity / availability at time of booking. This is covered in more detail in the README.md document. Included here will be the capability for the visitor to delete a booking and update a booking.
