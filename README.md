# West Clare Motorhome Park
The last number of years, possibly aided by the COVID pandemic and associated travel constraints, have seen an explosion in Motorhome ownership in Ireland. There have been three fundamental responses to this growth, the first is a rise in the number of motorhome parks in Ireland or the expansion of traditional camp sites to cater for motorhomes. Secondly, slowly but surely some councils are seeing the benefit of creating Aires ( one night pull in points) in towns and villages to facilitate safe parking / waste disposal etc. Finally, some councils when faced with the sudden influx of motorhomes are reacting negatively and putting bars on parking facilities to restrict access to cars.

When a potential customer accesses a motorhome website, especially for a place they have not been before, they have a number of questions in mind that they need answered quickly and clearly. These questions include where exactly is the motorhome park, what facilities are available, what are the site rules , how far is the site from a town etc, how much does it cost per night?  This website answers all those questions clearly on the landing page. 

The site then moves to answering the question - what sites of interest are nearby? Where can I daytrip to or eat etc ? The Explore page shows a non exhaustive list of famous locations in West Clare and includes links to the home websites for those places.  

The contact page answers questions like , how can I contact the site owners, can I leave an enquiry? This page details the site telephone number and email address , it also incorporates an enquiry form which enables the visitor to place an enquiry.

There is a comments page, during development, this was de-prioritised and is included in the the future work section. Right now the user will see a placeholder image.

Finally there is a booking page. This page facilitates the user making a booking, deleting a booking and modifying a booking. Several attempts were made to incorporate capacity feedback i.e. the site is full on those dates please pick different dates however due to time constraints this will be added as future work. See capacity.py to direction this was going.
